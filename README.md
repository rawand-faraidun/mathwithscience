## Usage
You can run this project this ways:

1. You can use `server` or `client` scripts to run any of them or cd into them and start them there.

running server: 
```npm
npm run server
```

running client: 
```npm
npm run client
```

2. Using React development seperatly fro server using `dev` script, by default the server runs on port **5000** and react development runs on port **3000**.
```npm
npm run dev
```

3. Using server to serve the static front-end *(this is how the website works)*, this can be done using `start` script.
```npm
npm run dev
```


**Note**: before running the project pay attention to this steps:

* Watch `.env.example` file in and make a `.env` file based on it.

* Run `client-prebuild` and `server-prebuild` scripts, or read `README.md` file from `server` and `client` to know more about how the project works.

**any contribution is being reviewed and tested before acceptng it.**

In general we are looking for this kind of contributions:

* Adding new features *(example: new calculators, new branches(new branches must have atlease one calculator), new languages)*

* Improving excisting features *(example: improvements in the functionality, improvment in rendering elements, simplifing the functionality)*

* fixing comments *all components are written only by me and I expect mistakes in them*

* If you want to contribute but not sure about it or if they fit in these points, don't worry about it because they are only just what we are looking for in the moment, but we appreciate any imporovment
